# Decoratable Christmas Trees
#### For Minecraft

![Tree Banner](/docs/tree-banner.png)

For all the christmas themed mods in Minecraft, none of them really felt like they give you the authentic experience of a christmas tree in your house. This mod provides the experience of having your own tree in your house, and if you choose, even have a small train driving around it thanks to integration with the [Model Trains Mod](https://github.com/Zenith08/Model-Trains-Mod)

## How it Works
The mod causes christmas trees to appear randomly in tree type biomes, each tree will have a random assortment of decorations on it for you to collect, the idea is to encourage everyone to go looking for the decorations to make their tree the best around.

## Modpacks and Liscencing
Whether you want to contribute, want to use the mod in a modpack, or something else the basic answer for liscencing is this:
- I don't want to have my mod become disconnected from me, so if you use it, give me credit.
- I don't want to take away credit from you, so if you contribute or extend it, let me know so I can include it on Github or Curseforge.
- I don't plan to proffit from this, so modpacks and the like are alright as long as you link to [Github](https://github.com/Zenith08/Decoratable-Christmas-Trees-Mod) or [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/decoratable-christmas-trees-mod).
